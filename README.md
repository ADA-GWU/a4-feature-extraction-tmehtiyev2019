# Feature Extraction

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python files for feature extraction with a focus on:

1. **Edge Analysis (`edge_analysis.ipynb`):** Edge detection, corner detection, and line and circle detection.
2. **Active Contour (`active_contour.py`):** Active Contour (snakes) algorithm for detecting the contours of objects.
3. **Interest Points (`interest_points.ipynb`):** Interest Point detection using ORB to locate the same object in different images.
